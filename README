### Project Name
   Critter Project
   
## Overview
   This is a Critter simulation project where Critters, (Fox and Rabbit) will live within a simulation.
   There will be different critters moving around the grid, interacting with the other critters, and 
   behaving according to the rules defined in each subclass.
   This purpose of this project is to simulate these animal-like behaviors while
   demonstrates key Java principles, such as inheritance, polymorphism, and interface.
   
### Prerequisites
   Install Java DEvelopment Kit (JDK) 
   Install jGrasp IDE (Inttegrated Development Enviornment) through their website https://www.jgrasp.org/
   Launch jGrasp and open  files.
   Use the "compile" button to compile all files in the project.
   
### Installation/Setup
   Launch jGrasp and create a new project and add your Critter files
   Ensure Java AWT library is imported  (java.awt.*;)
   Compile (click the green plus button) to make sure there are no errors
   Copy and paste the code and click the "RUN" button inside the Crittermain class.
   This will start the simulation.
   
## Usage:
      This project can be used through a series of commands to create new critters like Fox and Rabbit
      and to manage them. 
      People can call commands to see the interactions and behaviors of the critters

## Purpose
      #Rabbit:
         The puropse of the Rabbit's behaviors and interactions, is to run away from the fox, its predator.
         Their goals is to run away at the encounter of a fox, prioritizing its survival by increasing its speed. 
         As a rabbit, they can't fight a fox back, so the moment a fox is infront of them,
         their speed increases and they run.  
      
      #Fox:
         The purpose of the Fox's behavior and interactions, is to capture its prey. 
         Their goal is to capture their prey (infect), when it appears in front of it. 

## Patterns
      #Fox:
        In this project, the fox displays the same characteristics as a predator. With it's change of speed
        when hunting and increased hunger when they haven't hunted yet.
        
      #Rabbit:
         In this project, the rabbit displays the same characteristics as a prey. Like in a real-life
         situation, it focuses on evading its predator, which reflects it's survival instincts.
      
## Unique Properties
   # Fox (Subclass)
       The Fox class represents the predator in this project. It's Unique Properties are
         1.Speed
            - Walking speed: initial speed of 22 mph
            - Chasing speed: increases to 40 mph when chasing a rabbit
          The fox has two speed levels that inc/dec to mimic how it would be a predator in a hunting situation.
        
         2. Hunger Level
            - The hunger level starts at a level of 0. This means the fox is not hungry
            - Each turn when it doesn't catch a rabbit, it's hunger level increases. 
            - When it finally infects(eats) a rabbit, it's hunger is set back to 0.
          The fox has this hunger level reflects the fox's need to hunt when it get's hungry.

   # Rabbit (Subclass)
         The Rabbit class represents the prey in this simulation. It's Unique Properties are:
         1. Speed
            -Hopping Speed: initial speed of 18 mph
            -Running Speed: increases to 38 mph when a fox is in front
           The rabbit has two speed levels that inc/dec to mimic how it would be as a prey in a hunting situation
   
###Behaviors/Actions:
   # Rabbit
      Interaction with Foxes:
        - When a rabbit encounters a Fox, it's speed will increase because it is a predator, and it will turn it's direction to the left.
      Interaction with Walls:
         - When a rabbit encounters a fox, it's speed will decrease to the initial speed because it's not a predator, and it will turn to the right.
      Interaction with Open Space/Other Rabbits:
         - When a rabbit encounters either another rabbit or an open space in front of them, it's speed 
         will decrease to the initial speed and the rabbit will simply hop in the current direction it's facing.
      
## Contributing:
   Feel free to contribute to this Critter project by:
      -creating new subclasses with new critters adn adding the critter to the main class
      -overriding and implementing new behaviors/characteristics
